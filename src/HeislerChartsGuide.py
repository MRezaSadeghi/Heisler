    At first use have to defone configuration of the problem.
    There are there kind of shapes:
        1- Plane (W)
        2- Cylinder (C)
        3- Sphere (S)
    Also three types of charts:
        1- Center Temperature (CT)
        2- Internal Energy Chnage (IE)
        3- Temperature Distribution (TD)

        Show Plot Funtion Guide:
        Using this function based on made object, the plot related to the
        desired shape will be depicted. This function does not require and
        mandatory arguments. After running this function, the shown chart
        allows users to click on it and draw a vertical and a horizontal line
        to determine the accurate position of the selected point. You can check
        an unlimited number of points, and just by pressing X button on the top
        left corner, the chart will be closed.

        Unfortunately, in this version (1.0), the numeric analysis of the chart
        is not available, so users ought to select points and read its position
        manually. We are planning to make it easier to work with this package.

        Would you please send us your suggestion and feedback?
        Undoubtably we will embrace them.
