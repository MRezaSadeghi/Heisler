# Heisler Chart Guide

This is a Python library distributed on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/HeislerChartsGuide/) to increase the speed and accuracy of using the Heilser Chart. This package also provides users a simple additional calculator which allows users to calculate initial useful parameters for Heisler Chart [1].

Using ```show_plot``` based on made object, the plot related to thedesired shape will be depicted. This function does not require any mandatory arguments. After running this function, the shown chart allows users to click on it and draw a vertical and a horizontal line to determine the accurate position of the selected point. You can check an unlimited number of points, and just by pressing X button on the top left corner, the chart will be closed.

Unfortunately, in this version (1.0), the numeric analysis of the chart is not available, so users ought to select points and read its position manually. We are planning to make it easier to work with this package.

## Installation
use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Heisler Chart Guide in Python.
```python
pip install HeislerChartsGuide
```

## An Example (Chart)

Heisler Class Guide:

At first use have to defone configuration of the problem.
There are there kind of shapes:\
  1- Plane (W)\
  2- Cylinder (C)\
  3- Sphere (S)\

Also three types of charts:\
  1- Center Temperature (CT)\
  2- Internal Energy Chnage (IE)\
  3- Temperature Distribution (TD)\

Consider you want to use the Internal Energy chart for a plane wall.
```python
from HeislerChartsGuide import Heisler as hc
problem = hs("W", "IE", verbose = 0)
problem.show_plot()
```

## An Example (Calculator)
And if you want to use the calculator, you can add the below code to the previous one. Then you
```python
alpha = 8.4*10**-5 		#m2/s            Thermal diffusivity
L = 7/1000			#length [m]      Characteristic length (L = Volume/Area)
h = 200				#[W/m2.K]        Heat transfer coefficient
k = 215				#[W/mK.]         Thermal conductivity
t = 120				#time [s]        Elapsed time
Bi, Fo = problem.calculator(alpha, L, h, k, t, verbose = 1)
```
